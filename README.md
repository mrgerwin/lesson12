Pong, finishing the game

### Notes and Coding
Mr. Gerwin will lecture about programming the logic behind the game.  You should take notes and reproduce a working version of pong.  It would be best if you continued your version pong0-4.py but if you do not have one, one is provided.  Save your working program as pong0-5.py and upload it to the repository.

### Enhancements and Extensions
You must complete atleast 1 challenging extention and 3 normal extentions.

Normal Extentions:

1) Finish the drawCenterLine function

2) When the victory condition is met, render text onto the screen to say which player has won and what the user should do next to initialize a new game.  This text should disappear when a new game is launched.

3) Change the victory condition so that the first to 13 wins but you have to win by two.

4) Change the color and font of the score so that it fits your design choices already for the project.

5) As the score gets higher, increase the speed of the ball.

Challenging Enhancements:

1) Allow the player that scored to serve the ball from his/her paddle or atleast allow them to move the ball before it is served

2) Use the joystick module to use a gamepad to control the paddle

3) Make the game into a 4 player game.  You can make a paddle on the top and the bottom of each side or have a front player and a back player.  But you are not limited to those ideas.

4) Allow the user to make changes to the size of the ball or court or paddle before the game starts.  Make sure that the user is restricted to sizes that make sense.

5) Instead of using a circle and a rectangle for the game objects, use the sprite class and set the image property of the sprites to a gif that you have found that make sense for pong.  Sprite class also has a collide function that you can use instead of using the collide function for the Rect class. 

6) Program a simple computer player that will try to move the paddle towards the ball so that you can play against the computer.  In other words, it should be somewhat smart.

###### Save your program as pong1-0.py and upload your finished pong game to the repository.

### Discussion Questions
1. Explain your challenging enhancement.  What are some main features?
2. What was the most challenging part of your enhancement?  Why?
3. Did you make any early decisions that made it easier to program anything in this last lesson?  Explain.
